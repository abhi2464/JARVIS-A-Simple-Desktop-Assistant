# JARVIS-A-Simple-Desktop-Assistant
Created a simple desktop assistant using pythin and various APIs such as weather APi for giving the live updates of weather based on the live loaction, YouTube Data API for playing music on YouTube.
Also I have used Google's Gemini API for integrating Generative AI in the assistant.
